I built this extension so that Hubspot would be usable, as the default
view is incredibly bright. I also built this because there used to be
an extension that did this, but they authors started to charge a
monthly fee to use it. So lame!!!

Please share this on twitter to help it grow. Since it is free, the
only thing I am asking is that you share the extension with your
co-workers that also use Hubspot.

Cheers!!!!
