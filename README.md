# Frost's Extensions

Building extensions is a hobby. Sometimes I really enjoy building
and extension to change the way that I
experience the internet. The following are
a list of extensions I build since Summer 2021.
From now on I will post code to my extensions
here.

This is an extension to view New York Times articles without having to see the paywall.
