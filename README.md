# Frost's Extensions

Building extensions is a hobby. Sometimes I really enjoy building
and extension to change the way that I
experience the internet. The following are
a list of extensions I build since Summer 2021.
From now on I will post code to my extensions
here.

## NYTimes Free AF

This is an extension to view New York Times articles without having to see the paywall.
The paywall is crap, as I have to login every few days. Though
I have access and have logged in recently, it
makes me login again. Bugs me. Until they fix their
paywall, this.

## Playback Fast AF

Change YoutubeTV playback speed to 10x by pressing "A" key. Release "A" key to resume normal play.
Makes watching Football games easier.
